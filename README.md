The submitted code is a single ipython notebook, containing codes for:

(i) loading training graph from train.txt  
(ii) extracting features from JSON file  
(iii) dataset sampling  
(iv) feature engineering  
(v) scaling (optional and model-specific)  
(vi) training  
(vii) Reading from test_public.csv  
(viii) testing (and generating kaggle submission)  

To open the ipython notebook for exectuion, type the following on the command line:

$ jupyter notebook SML_Code_1103842.ipynb

OR, you can alternatively mount the ipython notebook on Google Colab directly.

In the ipython notebook that opens up, run the following sections of the code in the same order specified:

(i) Setting up Colab  
(ii) Initialise Experiment  
(iii) Extracting node information  
(iv) Approach 2 (Extra graph features)  
(v) Reading from test file for Approach 2  
(vi) Standard scaling of all features - OPTIONAL  
(vii) Testing for kaggle  
(viii) Approach 3 (Node2Vec) - OPTIONAL
